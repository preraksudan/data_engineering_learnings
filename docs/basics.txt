Getting data for data pipelines involves collecting information from diverse sources—databases, applications, files, and sensors—and moving it to a central repository like a data lake or warehouse. Methods vary based on required speed (latency) and volume, ranging from scheduled batch jobs to real-time streaming. 

Different ways to get data for data pipelines:

1. Data Ingestion Methods (How data is moved)
Batch Processing: Collects data over a period (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly) and processes it in a single, large batch. Suitable for historical data, payroll, or reporting.
Streaming/Real-Time Ingestion: Captures data as it is generated, offering low-latency, real-time insights (e.g., IoT data, financial transactions).
Change Data Capture (CDC): A specialized streaming method that identifies and captures only data that has changed (inserts, updates, deletes) in source databases, reducing the load on systems.
Micro-batching: A hybrid approach that splits data into very small, frequent batches (every few seconds), balancing the speed of streaming with the reliability of batch processing. 

2. Data Sources (Where data comes from)
Databases: Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra).
API-based Sources: Third-party services, social media, and SaaS applications (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
Files and Object Storage: CSV, JSON, XML, or Parquet files stored in cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage).
System and Application Logs: Data collected from web servers, applications, and system logs.
IoT/Edge Devices: Sensor data from manufacturing, smart city devices, or vehicles.
Web Scraping: Extracting structured data directly from websites. 

3. Data Acquisition Techniques (How data is accessed)
Log-based extraction: Reading transaction logs (similar to CDC).
Full extract: Pulling all data at once, useful for small datasets.
Incremental extraction: Using timestamps or version numbers to fetch only new data.
API Polling/Webhooks: Periodically asking APIs for new data or receiving notifications when data changes. 

4. Approaches to Building Data Pipelines
Manual Coding (DIY): Developers write scripts using Python, SQL, or specialized libraries. Offers high control but requires significant maintenance.
Managed Ingestion Tools/SaaS: Using platforms like Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, or Matillion, which offer pre-built connectors to simplify ingestion, often within minutes.
Cloud-Native Services: Utilizing cloud provider tools like AWS Glue, Amazon Kinesis, Google Cloud Dataflow, or Azure Data Factory. 

5. Data Types
Structured: Data organized in tables (SQL Databases, spreadsheets).
Semi-structured: Data with tags or keys (JSON, XML).
Unstructured: Data without a predefined format (text files, images, videos). 

Summary of Best Practices
Use ELT over ETL: Modern pipelines often use Extract, Load, Transform (ELT), which loads raw data into a cloud data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) first, then transforms it, enabling faster access and better flexibility.
Automate: As data complexity grows, automate ingestion to save time and reduce errors.
Ensure Idempotence: Design pipelines to handle failures without duplicating data.
Monitor: Implement data observability to detect schema changes and data quality issues.
